A real classic of Lithuanian kitchen, Christmas Eve is unimaginable without these treats.
Adapted to cooking in apartment building, with barely functional oven.

#### You'll need:

Amount | Ingredient
-----|-----
500g | flour
3 | eggs
250ml | milk
50g | fresh/frozen yeast
100g | sugar
A pinch | salt
2tbsp | vegetable oil
50g | poppy seeds

### Process

Warm up the milk (45-60s in the microwave), put in a teaspoon of sugar and stir in the yeast. Leave it to activate for 10min (any longer and the milk will "climb out" out of the cup).
Mix the milk, the rest of the sugar, salt and oil, break in the eggs, whisk it together.
Sift in the flour and pour in the poppy seeds. Knead, adding flour as needed until the dough
does not stick to your hands anymore.
Cover with moist cotton cloth and leave to rise, 60-90min (since this is a holiday treat and central heating in apartment buildings leaves a lot to be desired, rising takes a while).
Lightly knead again to distribute the yeast and leave to rise for another ~60min.
Roll around 1cm thick string. If you have a mincer with cookie forming attachment,
you can mince the dough through round or mostly square attachment. Cut the string
into 1cm wide pieces.
Spread on baking sheet covered tray and bake around 20min until the pieces turn golden.
There's no need to maintain distance between pieces since depending on your oven
you may need to turn them over -- and that's a lot easier when the pieces are stuck together.
