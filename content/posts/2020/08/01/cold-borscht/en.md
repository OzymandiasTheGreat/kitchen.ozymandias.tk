#### You'll need:

Amount | Ingredient
-----|-----
0.5l | pickled beetroots
1l | kefir
1  | long cucumber
A pinch | Fresh dill

#### Optional:

Amount | Ingredient
-----|-----
1 bunch | Spring onion
3â€“4 | hard boiled eggs
A few | Boiled potatoes


### Process

Chop the cucumber into 0.5cm squares, finely chop the dill.
If you're going to add onion or egg, do the same.
If you're going to serve with hot potatoes, save the dill for those, otherwise mix everything in a large pot.
Depending of the fat content of the kefir, you may need a bit of water to thin the soup.
Refrigerate, serve with hot boiled potatoes sprinkled with dill.

#### Notes

* Traditionally, boiled and grated beetroots where used, but pickled beetroots have more tang, which is very welcome here.
* Whether you add onions is purely preference.
* Egg on the other hand makes the soup much mealier, if you want it light and refreshing, skip it.
* According to Wikipedia, radish can also be added. Never seen this in Lithuania though.
* I've seen people put the hot potatoes straight into the soup. That's silly, it ruins temperature balance.
