#### You'll need:

Amount | Ingredient
-----|-----
1 | large egg white
80g | granulated sugar

### Process

Whisk the egg white with sugar until it forms soft peaks (it's never gonna form stiff peaks because of all the sugar.)
Scoop up the mass with teaspoon and place on baking sheet covered tray. (Or better yet, fill confectioners syringe and make pretty little puffs.)
Bake for 25min at 180 degrees C.

One portion makes about half full-sized baking tray.
