#### For the Dough:

Amount | Ingredient
-----|-----
100ml | milk
50g  | fresh yeast
1tsp | sugar
3 | large eggs
500g | flour
A pinch | salt


#### For the Filling:

Amount | Ingredient
-----|-----
500g | meat (chicken or pork)
200g | cheese (prefer Mozzarella)
1 cube | dry mushroom bouillon

### Process

Warm up the milk in microwave (45-60s), add the sugar and yeast (don't worry, there'll be no sweetness when the yeast is done). Leave it for ~10min so yeast activates.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs and salt. Pour in the milk with yeast. Mix it again.
Sift in flour couple tablespoons at a time, until you can knead the dough and it almost not sticking to your hands.
Cover with moist cotton cloth and leave to rise for 60-90min.
Lightly knead the dough to distribute the yeast evenly and let it rise another ~60min.

While the dough is rising, make the filling. Put the meat in cold water and bring it to a boil.
Strain the meat, pour in more cold water, add the bouillon and let it boil until the meat is cooked.
Mince the meat, mince or finely grate the cheese and mix it together.
Add couple of tablespoons of meat/mushroom bouillon and mix. Repeat until thick paste forms.
Refrigerate it, this way it will be easier to wrap in dough.

Cut off a large piece of dough and roll it ~0.3cm thick. Use a large glass or round cookie cutter to make dough circles. Put a large teaspoon of filling in a middle of dough circle, fold it in half and then fold the edges so the filling doesn't leak out. Rinse and repeat.

Heat 5-6cm of vegetable oil in a large pan on medium heat. Put in the pirozhki and fry until golden. When one side is done flip them over, and again - until golden.

Spread a couple paper towels in large bowl and fish the pirozhki out of oil.
The paper towel will absorb excess oil, so the pirozhki on the bottom don't get soggy.
