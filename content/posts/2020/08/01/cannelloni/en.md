In another pan fry the spinnach on low to medium heat until it shrinks.
Strain the spinnach and mix it with fried pork and chopped spices.
Whisk the egg and mix it with the pork.

For the sauce, melt a couple of spoons of butter in a pan on low heat, add a spoon or two of flour and fry until flour browns slightly. Pour in a glass of milk slowly, stirring constantly.
When the milk start thickening, add the cheeses bit by bit, again constantly stirring.

Bake for 40min.
