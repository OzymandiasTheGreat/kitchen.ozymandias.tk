Every Lithuanian child's favorite dessert!

#### You'll need:

Amount | Ingredient
-----|-----
1kg | plain biscuits (I prefer Selga)
1 can (400g) | sweetened condensed milk
200g | butter
250g | margarine
4tbsp | granulated sugar
5tbsp | premium cocoa

### Process

Crumble cookies to about 1 cm sized pieces.
Melt butter and margarine in a pot on low heat. Stir in sugar. Once it's melted, add condensed milk and stir until it's completely blended. Take it off heat and  let it cool a bit.
Stir in cocoa and pour it over the cookie crumbs. Mix well, pour into baking form and put it in the fridge for several hours.

#### Note

I know a lot of people don't like margarine, but it really works well here. You can use pure butter, but the end result will be much tougher.
