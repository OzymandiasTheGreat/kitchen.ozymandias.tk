#### For the Dough:

Amount | Ingredient
-----|-----
180ml | warm milk
30g | fresh yeast
50g | granulated sugar
1 | egg at room temperature
1 | egg yolk at room temperature
60g | melted butter
360g | flour
1tsp | salt


#### For the Filling:

Amount | Ingredient
-----|-----
120g | brown sugar
2tbsp | ground cinnamon
60g | softened butter

### Process

Put the yeast and 1 teaspoon of sugar in warm milk, mix it well and let it sit for ~10min.
Whisk the egg and the egg yolk with remaining sugar.
Mix the milk, the eggs and melted butter. Sift in the flour and the salt. Knead well for a few minutes.

Cover the dough with moist cotton cloth and let it rise for 60-90min. Lightly knead again and let it rise for another ~60min.

While the dough is rising, put the filling ingredients into a bowl and use hand mixer to whisk it together. Or you can use a blender if you have one.

Roll the dough on floured surface into roughly square shape. Use a spoon or butter knife to spread the filling evenly on dough, leaving a couple centimeters from the edges.

Roll up the dough and use dental floss to cut it into ~3cm slices. Place the slices onto
baking tray covered with baking sheet, keeping a few centimeters between them.

Bake until golden, but still soft in the middle.
