 Amount | Ingredient
 ------ | ------
 1      | large egg white
 80 g   | granulated sugar
 A dash | lemon juice

 ---

Whisk the egg white with the sugar and the lemon juice until it forms soft peaks (it's never going to form stiff peaks because of all the sugar). Scoop ip the mass with a teaspoon and place on baking sheet covered tray (or better yet, fill up confectioners syringe with the mass and make pretty little puffs). Bake for 25 minutes at 180Â°C.

One portion makes about half full-sized baking tray.
