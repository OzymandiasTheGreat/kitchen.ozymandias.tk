 900 g         | plain biscuits (I use either Selga or Leibniz)
 1 can (400 g) | sweetened condensed milk

Crumble the biscuits to about 1 cm sized pieces. Melt the butter and the margarine in a pot over low heat. Stir in the sugar. Keep stirring 'til the sugar completely melts. Still stirring, pour in the condensed milk. Keep stirring 'til it's completely incorporated and uniform. Turn off the heat and let it cool around 10-15 minutes.

Stir in cacao and pour the mass over the biscuit crumbs. Mix well, pour it into deep, narrow, baking tray and put in the fridge overnight.

I know a lot of people don't like margarine, but it really works well here. You can use all butter (replacing margarine with equal amount of butter), but the end result will be much tougher to bite.
