 Amount   | Ingredient
 -------- | --------
 0.5 l    | pickled beetroots (pickled in apple juice works best)
 1 l      | kefir (buttermilk works in a pinch)
 3-4      | cucumbers
 To taste | fresh or salted dill
 To taste | spring onion
 3-4      | hard boiled eggs
 A pinch  | salt

 > Spring onion and hard boiled eggs are optional

Chop the cucumbers into bite sized pieces. Finely chop the dill and the spring onion. You can either chop the hard boiled eggs, or slice them in half and place them directly in the plate when serving the soup. Mix everything in a large pot. If the soup seems too thick, use boiled or filtered water to dilute it.
Refrigerate for a few hours, the soup will taste much better than freshly made.
Serve with hot potatoes.

Few things to note:

 - Traditionally, boiled and grated beetroots were used. However pickled beetroots have more tang, which is very welcome here.
 - Egg and spring onion are popular additions, to the point where most Lithuanians consider them essential. Personally, I'm not a fan.
 - According to Wikipedia radish can also be added. Never seen this in practice tho.
 - I've seen people put the hot potatoes straight into the soup. That's silly, it ruins the temperature balance.
