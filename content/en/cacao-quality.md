Have you ever baked a chocolate pie that didn't quite taste like chocolate?

The issue is the cacao. Most cacao, especially cheap brands, is around 12% fat, which is quite low. This cacao tastes like sawdust.

Instead, when buying cacao, make sure fat content is at least 22%. This usually not advertised, but you can look at nutritional label - look for cacao with 1 gram (instead of 0.5 gram) of fat per 5 to 6 gram serving, or at least 22 gram fat content per 100 gram.

This will greatly improved the flavor of pies, cookies, and yes, hot chocolate too.
