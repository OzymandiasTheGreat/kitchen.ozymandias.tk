First, let's make the Mornay sauce. In deep pan, on low heat, melt the butter. Throw in the flour and mix well until golden. Without stopping the mixing, slowly pour in the milk, little bit at a time. Once the milk begins to thicken start adding the cheeses, a handful at a time. Don't stop the mixing until all the cheese is incorporated into the sauce.

Now let's make the filling. Melt the butter in a pan over low heat. Toss in the spinach. Once the spinach shrinks, drain the liquid. In a large bowl mix the spinach and the remaining ingredients. Stuff the cannelloni.

In a large baking dish pour in the tomato sauce. Arrange the cannelloni and cover with Mornay sauce. Bake for 40 minutes in 180Â°C.
