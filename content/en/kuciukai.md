 Amount | Ingredient
 ------ | ------
 500 g  | all purpose flour
 3      | eggs

Warm up the milk (60s in the microwave on high setting), put in a teaspoon of sugar and the yeast. Mix until yeast melts, then let the yeast activate, about 10 minutes. In a large, shallow bowl mix the milk, the rest of sugar, oil, eggs, and poppy seeds. Mix the flour with the salt and sift it into the egg mass. Knead, adding flour as needed, until the dough does not stick to your hands. Cover the dough with a damp cotton cloth and let it rise for about 60 minutes.
Cut off a piece of dough and roll it into a string about 1 cm thick. Cut into 1 cm thick pieces. Spread a baking sheet onto a baking tray and put the pieces on it. Bake on both sides until golden.
