Gently put the eggs into the boiling water and boil for 7 minutes. Strain the eggs and put them into cold water. Leave them to cool for another 15 minutes. Peel the eggs, cut them in half length-wise, and take out the yolks.

In a bowl mix the egg yolks with mayo, mustard, paprika, and pepper. Scoop up the mass with a teaspoon and put it back into the egg whites.
