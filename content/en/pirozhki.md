Put the milk in the microwave on high setting for 60 seconds. Pour the sugar and the yeast into the warm milk and mix until yeast melts (sugar helps the yeast activate, there will be no sweetness in the dough). Let it rest for about 10 minutes until the yeast activates. In a large, shallow bowl mix the milk and the eggs. Mix the flour with the salt and sift into the milk and egg mixture. Knead until the dough stops sticking to your hands. Cover with a damp cotton cloth and leave the dough to rise for about 60 minutes.

While the dough is rising, make the filling. Put the meat in cold water and bring to a boil. Strain the meat, pour in clean water, and add the bouillon. Boil for 30 minutes or until the meat is cooked. Let the meat cool, then mince it and add the cheese. Add a few spoons of the meat/mushroom stock until a thick paste forms.

Cut off a piece of dough and roll it thinly. Use a glass to cut out circles from the rolled dough. Put a teaspoon of filling paste in the middle of a circle and fold it. Fold the edges so it forms a neat little dumpling. Rinse and repeat.

Pour 1 l of vegetable or similar oil into a frying pan on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, put in a few pirozhki and fry until golden. When one side turns golden, flip them over, and again, fry until golden.

Spread a couple paper towels in a large bowl and fish out the pirozhki into it. The paper towel will absorb excess oil, preventing pirozhki from getting soggy.
