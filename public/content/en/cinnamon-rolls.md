Put the yeast and 1 teaspoon of sugar in warm milk and mix until yeast melts, then let it rest for about 10 minutes.
Whisk the egg and the egg yolk with remaining sugar. Mix the milk, the egg mass, and the melted butter. In separate bowl sift the flour and mix in the salt. Then mix everything together and knead well for a few minutes.

Cover the dough with a damp cotton cloth and let it rise. How long depends on temperature and humidity. On a typical Lithuanian summer 60 minutes is more than enough. It may take 90 minutes or more during cold season.

While the dough is rising, pour the filling ingredients into a bowl and use hand mixer to whisk it together. A blender also works if you have one.

Roll the dough on a floured surface into roughly square shape, around 1 cm thick. Use a spoon, or a butter knife, to spread the filling evenly, leaving a couple centimeters from the edges.

Roll up the dough and use dental floss to cut it into about 3 cm slices. Place the slices onto baking tray covered with a baking sheet leaving a few centimeters space between them.

Bake until golden, but still soft in the middle, around 40 minutes.
