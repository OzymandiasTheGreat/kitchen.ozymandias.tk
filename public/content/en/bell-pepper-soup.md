Cut the pork into bite sized cubes, season with crushed garlic, black pepper, chilli powder, and salt. Let it rest for a bit.

Slice the carrots, cut bell peppers into thin strips, wash the beans. In large pot over high heat fry the pork. When pork slightly browns, add the carrots. Once carrots are about cooked, add the bell peppers, stir well, and fry until they soften. Melt the bouillon in hot water and pour over the pork and vegetables. Once the water boils, add the beans, lightly stir, let it simmer for 15 minutes.
